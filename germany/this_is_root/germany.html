		<p class="text_1b">1. History</p>

		<p class="text_1b">Germany has played a huge role in both world wars in the 20th century, and it has a really interesting and engaging history. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, ending the Cold War, Germany reunited and overcame the challenges of a divided nation. Today, Germany is one of the largest beer producers in the world and a huge player in many industries and on the global stage in general, and has joined the United Nations, EU, and NATO.</p>

		<p class="text_1b">2. Geography</p>

		<p class="text_1b">Here are a few facts about the geography of Germany: <br> <br>
		a. Germany is the seventh (7th) largest country in Europe, with a land mass of 357,022 km² (357K). <br>
		b. Germany borders Denmark to the north, Poland and the Czech Republic to the east, Austria to the southeast, and Switzerland to the southwest. <br>
		c. The highest mountain in Germany, the Zugspitze, has a highest point of 2,962 metres. That is almost 3 times higher than Hungary's highest point, Mount Kékes, topping at 1,014 metres. (~2.92 times higher | 2962 / 1014)
